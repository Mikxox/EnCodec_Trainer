# EnCodec_Trainer

Implementation to add training function with loss to https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec \
Used audio_to_mel.py from https://github.com/descriptinc/melgan-neurips \
Some minor adjustments to other code to add new model. \
Changes to the forward function in model.py to make training quantizer easier. \
Only training.py & customAudioDataset.py is new code. \
You can use testing.py to use the trained model, however we use struct as a binary writer. \
This loses some compression power since we have to write 16bits instead of 10bits. \
Download the used database e-gmd from https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/e-gmd

### Important Notice
This code is meant as proof of concept trainer code used to try and train an EnCodec model from scratch.
I did not delve into how the codebooks get updated for quantization.
The quantization code training thus still works via the original code and this means codebooks still get updated when using testing.py.
You will need to put the model in evaluation mode for real-world usage and codebooks might not be well-trained for this.
It is thus recommended to use the pre-trained model made available by the facebook research team as a basis for retraining.
